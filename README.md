# Fruits_Classification_R

Implement some simple classification algorithms on a fruit data set by R.


## Background
This repo implemented some simple classification algorithms on a fruit data set by R.

This was inspired by the following blog post:

[Solving A Simple Classification Problem with Python — Fruits Lovers’ Edition](https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-a-simple-classification-problem-with-python-fruits-lovers-edition-d20ab6b071d2)

which was implemented by python.

The data set was created by Dr. Iain Murray from University of Edinburgh, and then the professors at University of Michigan formatted the fruits data slightly and it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/susanli2016/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/fruit_data_with_colors.txt).
